This folder contains debug endpoints for testing how web-control would respond if it was connected to the API.
In order to simulate a Rest-API endpoint, create a .json file in the full path as if it was the endpoint (/sensors/temperature will be in folder sensors defined in temperature.json)
After calling the endpoint, contents of the json will be returned.
Only works if debug mode is enabled.
